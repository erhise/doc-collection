When Angular creates the DOM nodes to render the content of the template, it needs a place to store the references to those DOM nodes. Internally there is a data structure known as <strong>View</strong>. </p>\n<h3>Bindings</h3>\n<p>Compiler analyzes the template and identifies properties of the DOM elements that may need to be updated during change detection. For each such property, the compiler creates a <strong>binding</strong>. The binding defines the property name to update and the expression that Angular uses to obtain a new value.</p>","excerpt":"Brief summary of Angular Change Detection Two main building blocks of change detection in Angular: a component view the associated bindingsâ€¦","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/angular"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Angular Change Detection","tags":["angular"],"date":"2018-12-30"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docs/angular-change-detection/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/shortcuts-ubuntu/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Shortcuts Ubuntu","tags":["ubuntu","shortcuts"]}},"next":null}}
